## Reflection / Comments

Working on this assignment stretched my knowledge in several ways.  
I had to spend a few days brainstorming how to execute the blueprint and translate my ideas into a working diagram.  

I practiced and improved my skills with **GitHub** and **Markdown formatting**.  
This was also my **first time using draw.io**, so I spent time learning how to design diagrams and connect elements correctly.  

Despite the challenges, I was able to complete the diagram successfully, and the process boosted my confidence in applying these tools.
