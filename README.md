Conceptual Data Pipeline Design for Handling Customer Complaints - Beejan Technologies

#  Beejan Technologies â€“ Conceptual Data Pipeline

## Overview
This repository outlines the conceptual design of Beejan Technologiesâ€™ end-to-end **data pipeline** for managing and analyzing multi-channel customer complaints.  
The pipeline integrates **social media, call center logs, SMS, and website forms**, supporting both **batch** and **real-time streaming** ingestion.  
It ensures data quality, centralized storage, enriched data, and efficient delivery for **analytics, dashboards, and operational decision-making**.

The design emphasizes:
- Hybrid ingestion (batch + streaming + APIs)  
- Standardized complaint classification schema  
- Cloud-ready architecture with Data Lake + Data Warehouse layers  
- Orchestration, monitoring, and DataOps practices

## Conceptual Design

| **Step** | **Questions** | **Answer (Conceptual Design)** |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **1. Source Identification** | - What are the data sources?<br>- What formats and frequency (batch/streaming)? | Sources: Social media, call center logs, SMS, website forms.<br>Formats: JSON (APIs), CSV/log files, free-text, relational DB exports.<br>Frequency: Streaming (social media, SMS), Batch (call logs, website forms). |
| **2. Ingestion Strategy** | - API ingestion, file uploads, or streaming?<br>- Real-time handling? | Hybrid ingestion:<br>- Batch for logs/forms.<br>- Streaming for social media/SMS.<br>- APIs for live feeds. |
| **3. Processing / Transformation** | - How will you clean & standardize data?<br>- How will complaints be categorized? | Cleaning: Deduplication, null handling, timestamp normalization, schema unification.<br>Standardization: Convert into a **common complaint schema**.<br>Categorization: Text classification â†’ billing, network, service, etc. |
| **4. Storage Options** | - Do you need a Data Lake? A Warehouse?<br>- Storage formats? | Data Lake for **raw + curated** data.<br>Data Warehouse for **analytics-ready** data.<br>Columnar formats (Parquet) for optimized querying. |
| **5. Serving** | - How will the data be queried?<br>- How will downstream users consume it? | Query: SQL for analysts, dashboards for managers.<br>Consumption: BI dashboards, self-service analytics, APIs feeding operational systems. |
| **6. Orchestration & Monitoring** | - How often will pipeline run?<br>- How will failures be tracked? | Frequency: Streaming (continuous) + Batch (hourly/daily).<br>Monitoring: Alerts on failures, **data quality checks**, SLA tracking. |
| **7. DataOps** | - Where will the pipeline run?<br>- How will it be productionized? | Environment: Cloud / hybrid.<br>Deployment: Automated workflows (CI/CD).<br>Governance: Version control, role-based access, compliance enforcement. |

## ðŸ“– Assumptions
- The company collects data across **multiple channels** (phone, email, chat, social media).  
- Complaint data needs to be both **historical (batch)** and **real-time (streaming)**.  
- Business users require both **raw complaint text** (for detailed review) and **processed insights** (for dashboards).  
---

##  Summary of Challenges & Unknowns
- **Data Quality** â†’ Social media/call log data may be noisy, incomplete, or unstructured.  
- **Integration Complexity** â†’ Consistent IDs across channels may be difficult to maintain.  
- **Scalability** â†’ Streaming data may grow rapidly, requiring infrastructure scaling.  
- **Change Management** â†’ Teams shifting from spreadsheets need training on dashboards/self-service analytics.  
- **Compliance** â†’ Customer data must comply with regulations (e.g., **GDPR**).

##  Issues Solved by the Pipeline
- Eliminates **siloed complaint data** by centralizing multiple sources.  
- Provides **near real-time monitoring** of customer issues (e.g., social media escalations).  
- Ensures **clean, standardized complaint records** for reliable reporting.  
- Enables **trend analysis** to identify recurring pain points (e.g., billing errors).  
- Supports **operational efficiency** by making complaint data accessible to analysts, managers, and frontline staff.
